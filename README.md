The main focus of our project is to develop an application for physically challenged people- blind deaf and mute. An App can capture the image or either it can be uploaded from the gallery as well, with description of voice as well as text. That description and image can be stored in cloud for future reference. Secondly, we are planning for voice to text and vice versa translation approach for deaf and mute people. If they are in trouble or they required help then they can even send the text, email or call to their emergency contact. Language translation can help people to convert the text of their own to other different languages either by voice or text. We thought of adding more than ten different languages such as Hindi, German, Spanish, France, Japanese etc. Our main approach for this app is that in some or other way it should be helpful to society.
